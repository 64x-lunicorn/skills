# Architecture decisions

One file per decision, `NNNN-<slug>.md`, numbered in order and never renumbered. A decision is not edited once accepted: a new ADR supersedes it, and the old one stays with its status pointing to the new one.

## Format

```markdown
# NNNN — <Title>

Status: <proposed | accepted | superseded by [NNNN](NNNN-<slug>.md)>, YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

## Decision

## Consequences

## Alternatives
```

A `## Verification` section before Consequences records how the decision was checked, when it was.
